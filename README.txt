When I was thinking of a "Data Project" centered around Royal Caribbean, the
possibilities seemed endless. I decided on creating a Beacon-based project,
from looking at the world's tallest waterslide in North America and thinking to
myself, "as a kid I would want to know how fast I went down that slide". From
leaderboards at the bottom of slides that would give kids their times, to the
ability for parents to keep tabs on where their kids are, to enabling network
analysis for data mining purposes, beacons would greatly help Royal Caribbean
to continue advancing the quality of their vacations to their guests.
